# monarchive

Monarchive has been the product of a few months of work. To put it simply, it's a colour scheme for people who want beautiful colours but are sick of blue-tinted blacks and saturated colours. Heavy inspiration was taken from Catppuccin, and some more from gruvbox to fix what doesn't work for me in Catppuccin.
